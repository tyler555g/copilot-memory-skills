# Memory Defrag

Reorganize memory files for clarity, efficiency, and relevance. Like filesystem defragmentation but for knowledge.

## When to Run

- **Periodic**: Weekly or biweekly via cron (recommended)
- **On demand**: User asks to clean up, reorganize, or defrag memory
- **Threshold**: When MEMORY.md exceeds ~500 lines or daily notes accumulate without consolidation

## Process

### 1. Audit Current State

Inventory all memory files:
```
MEMORY.md           — long-term memory
memory/             — daily notes, tasks, topical files
memory/tasks/       — active and completed tasks
```

For each file, note: line count, last modified, topic coverage, staleness.

### 2. Identify Problems

Look for these common issues:

| Problem | Signal | Fix |
|---------|--------|-----|
| **Bloated file** | >300 lines, covers many topics | Split into focused files |
| **Duplicate info** | Same fact in multiple places | Consolidate to one location |
| **Stale entries** | References to completed work, old dates, resolved issues | Remove or archive |
| **Resolved error traces** | Debugging logs, failed-attempt history, closed-issue workarounds | Remove — context noise once resolved |
| **Orphan files** | Files in memory/ never referenced or updated | Review, merge, or remove |
| **Inconsistencies** | Contradictory information across files | Resolve to ground truth |
| **Poor organization** | Related info scattered across files | Restructure by topic |
| **Recursive nesting** | `memory/memory/memory/...` directories | Delete nested dirs (indexer bug artifact) |

### Resolved Error Traces

Resolved error traces deserve special attention:
- Debugging step-by-step logs from incidents that are now closed
- "Tried X, failed because Y" histories where the issue is resolved
- Workaround instructions for bugs that have been fixed
- Error symptoms and their old diagnoses when the root cause is gone

**Why they're harmful:** When retrieved as context, they look like current problems. A fresh agent reading "reconnect loop crashes the server — workaround: restart manually" doesn't know it was fixed last week. This creates false alerts and wastes context budget on phantom issues.

**The rule:** Once an issue is resolved and the fix is documented or deployed, remove the error trace. If there's a lesson worth preserving, distill it to a `[lesson]` observation — one line, not a log.

```python
# Before: three lines of stale error context
# - [issue] MCP server crashes on reconnect — repro: disconnect and reconnect rapidly
# - [workaround] Restart the MCP server manually after each disconnect
# - [status] investigating

# After: one line of distilled lesson
edit_note(
  identifier="MEMORY",
  operation="find_replace",
  find_text="- [issue] MCP server crashes on reconnect...\n- [workaround]...\n- [status] investigating",
  content="- [lesson] MCP reconnect stability: fixed in v2.1.0 — upgrade if seeing crashes #mcp"
)
```

### 3. Plan Changes

Before making edits, write a brief plan:
```markdown
## Defrag Plan
- [ ] Split MEMORY.md "Key People" section → memory/people.md
- [ ] Remove resolved error traces from MEMORY.md
- [ ] Remove completed tasks older than 30 days from memory/tasks/
- [ ] Merge memory/bm-marketing-ideas.md into memory/competitive/
- [ ] Update stale project status entries in MEMORY.md
```

### 4. Execute

Apply changes one at a time:
- **Split**: Extract sections from large files into focused topical files
- **Merge**: Combine related small files into coherent documents
- **Prune**: Remove information that is no longer relevant or accurate
- **Restructure**: Move files to appropriate directories, rename for clarity
- **Update**: Fix outdated facts, dates, statuses
- **Strip error traces**: Remove resolved debugging history — leave only lessons

### 5. Verify & Log

After changes:
- Verify no valuable information was lost (compare before/after)
- Update any cross-references between files
- Log what was done in today's daily note:

```markdown
## Memory Defrag (HH:MM)
- Files reviewed: N
- Split: [list]
- Merged: [list]
- Pruned: [list]
- Error traces removed: [count]
- Net result: X files, Y total lines (was Z lines)
```

## Guidelines

- **Preserve raw daily notes.** Don't delete or modify `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files — they're the audit trail.
- **Target 15-25 focused files.** Too few means bloated files; too many means fragmentation. Aim for the sweet spot.
- **File names should be scannable.** Use descriptive names: `people.md`, `project-status.md`, `competitive-landscape.md` — not `notes-2.md`.
- **Don't over-organize.** One level of directories is usually enough. `memory/tasks/` and `memory/competitive/` are fine; `memory/work/projects/active/basic-memory/notes/` is not.
- **Completed tasks**: Tasks with `status: done` older than 14 days should be archived (not deleted). Their insights should already be in MEMORY.md via reflection.
- **Ask before destructive changes.** If uncertain whether information is still relevant, keep it with a `(review needed)` tag rather than deleting.
- **Distill, don't just remove.** When pruning error traces or stale observations, ask if there's a one-line lesson worth keeping before deleting entirely.
